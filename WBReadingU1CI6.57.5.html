Katherine Demopoulos meets students who took a break from study to volunteer overseas and returned with a new sense of purpose.
The majority of 18-year-old students entering higher education go straight from school to university. For many school leavers, however, there is the irresistible attraction of the ‘gap year’, a time between school and university when they decide to experience something new, different or exciting. Many of these so-called ‘gappers’ go off travelling around the world, often supplementing their limited funds by taking on casual work, while others may do voluntary work in a village in a distant part of the world.
For the majority of gappers, the gap year is simply a chance to enjoy life as an independent adult for the first time. Increasingly, however, they are also proving a great way of reinvigorating a lapsed or flagging interest in education, offering a chance to think about why you should study, or if you need to study at all. A growing number of students, having taken a break after school, are heading back into further and higher education via a roundabout route of working and ‘gapping’. According to the latest data from the British university admissions service, UCAS, 105,000 students aged 19, and 44,400 aged 20, entered higher education last year – figures that show a steady annual increase in this age group over the previous three years.
19-year-old student Christine Samways is a typical example. She left school at 16 with nine good exam passes at grades A to C, but did not want to continue studying at the time. She was also worried that, despite having all the attributes of a good student, she would find the challenges of higher education too great and would be forced to drop out. Instead, she gained a vocational qualification in hairdressing. However, she very quickly began to realise it was not quite what she wanted and that going back into some kind of education could be her next step. Like many 16-year-old school leavers starting work for the first time, it dawned on her that if you don’t have qualifications, or the right qualifications, you have fewer work choices. ‘The things that you want to do just aren’t available to you,’ she says.
Unsure of what her next step should be, Christine decided to head to Mexico to do voluntary work at a children’s home. She was there for a year under the auspices of the International Cultural Youth Exchange (ICYE) – an organisation which has been running since 1949, when it sent 50 German students to the US as peace ambassadors. She never expected that working in Mexico would give her such a sense of confidence and, perhaps just as importantly, direction. On returning home to the UK, she decided to make a fresh start in education by enrolling on a course in Social Sciences and Humanities to prepare herself for university. Her new sense of confidence helped at her college interview. Previously, a formal interview would have made her very nervous, but she now found it much easier to talk on an informal and formal level to people she didn’t know. ‘I feel more comfortable in these situations,’ she says. ‘Mexico was the first time I’d been out of my comfort zone. Now I think I can cope with things better.’
Christine is now working towards a degree in International Development at Bath University, a choice of subject informed by her experience of working with Mexican children. And, as well as finding some direction in her career, she now speaks good Spanish – a skill she says she intends to keep up, perhaps by working abroad. She knows that the Mexican children’s home benefited from her time there, just as she did. As well as being ‘an extra pair of hands’, she helped to streamline the children’s timetable so they spent more structured time on homework. The children began to ‘do better in school,’ she says. ‘You only move up a year if you pass a year – I got four children that at the beginning of the year were told they were going to stay down, but they moved up. It’s a good feeling.’
ICYE also brings students to Europe from the countries that European students traditionally visit. Agnes Eldad, from Kampala, Uganda, has just graduated with a degree in Social Work. She came to the UK in January this year, getting a voluntary work placement relieving full-time carers of elderly people in Bexleyheath, Kent. With her social work background, she wanted to understand how elderly people were treated in Britain and to see for herself how their relationships with their children, grandchildren and in-laws worked.
Agnes found the experience extremely beneficial, but says that the ICYE only really works if participants have a focus for what they want to do, see and study. Ironically, for her, this could be the only chance to work with elderly people before she goes back home in January. In Uganda, old people live with, and are supported by, their families, so she won’t have an opportunity to work with them. Instead, she now wants to set up her own vocational training programme for young girls in northern Uganda. Agnes says her time in the UK has helped her to set her goals for the future.
