                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">An invention to dye for: the colour purple</h2>
                <div class="article-content text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-base">
A 19th century research chemist was trying to make medicine when, instead, he came up with a coloured dye that has ensured the world is a brighter place.
AOf all the colours, purple has perhaps the most powerful connotations. From the earliest cultures to the present day, people have sought to harness its visual power to mark themselves out as better than those around them. From bishops to kings, pop stars to fashion models, its wearing has been a calculated act of showing off. In ancient Rome, for example, purple was such a revered colour that only the emperor was allowed to wear it. Indeed, an emperor who was referred to as porphyrogenitus, (‘born to the purple’) was especially important, since this meant that he had inherited his position through family connections rather than seizing power through military force.
BBut why purple? At that time, purple dye was an expensive substance produced in a complicated, foul-smelling and time-consuming process. This involved boiling thousands of molluscs in water in order to harvest their glandular juices. The technique had originally been developed by the Phoenicians over a thousand years previously, and it hadn’t changed since. Cheaper but poorer quality purple dyes could be made from lichens using an equally messy and unpleasant procedure, but they were not as bright, and the colour quickly faded. It was no surprise, therefore, that good purple dye was a rare and precious thing, and clothes dyed purple were beyond the financial means of most people.
CHowever, times have changed. In the great consumer democracy of the 21st century, even the most humble citizen can choose it as the colour of their latest outfit. For that privilege, we must thank a young 19th century research chemist, William Perkin. A talented 15-year-old when he entered the Royal College of Chemistry in London in 1853, Perkin was immediately appointed as laboratory assistant to his tutor, August Wilhelm von Hofmann. He became determined to prove Hofmann’s claim that quinine, a drug used to treat fevers such as malaria, could be synthesised in a laboratory. However, rather than the cure desperately needed for people dying from malaria in tropical countries, he produced little more than a black, sticky mess that turned purple when dissolved in industrial alcohol. Perkin’s experiments could have been a complete waste of time, but to his surprise and, ultimately, financial benefit, his purple liquid turned out to be a long-lasting dye that was to transform fashion.
DPerkin repeated his experiments in an improvised laboratory in his garden shed, perfecting the process for making the substance he had called mauveine after the French mallow plant. It was, says Simon Garfield, the author of Mauve which details Perkin’s life and work, an astonishing breakthrough. ‘Once you could do that you could make colour in a factory from chemicals rather than insects or plants. It opened up the prospect of mass-produced artificial dyes and made Perkin one of the first scientists to bridge the gap between pure chemistry and its industrial applications.’ It didn’t take long for the chemist, still only 18, to capitalise on his creation, patenting the product, convincing his father and brother to back it with savings, and finding a manufacturer who could help him bring it rapidly to the market. The buying public loved it, and clothes coloured with purple started appearing in shops up and down the country.
Appropriately, considering the origins of Perkin’s colour, he was to receive a helping hand from the two most important women of the day. Queen Victoria caused a sensation when she stepped out at the Royal Exhibition in 1862 wearing a silk gown dyed with mauveine. In Paris, Napoleon III’s wife, Empress Eugenie, amazed the court when she was seen wearing it. To propel the scientist further on the way to a great fortune, the fashion of the time was for broad skirts that, happily for him, needed a lot of his revolutionary new dye.
E Perkins, ever the serious scientist, would have been among the first to point out that his mauve is just one of a range of colours described in everyday language as purple. Not itself a true colour of the spectrum – that position is given to indigo and violet – purple normally refers to those colours which inhabit the limits of human perception in the area between red and violet. Newton excluded the colour from his colour wheel. Scientists today talk about the ‘line of purples’ which include violet, mauve, magenta, indigo and lilac.
FIn the alternative medical practice of colour therapy, which practitioners say can trace its origins back to ancient India, the ‘purple range’ colours of indigo and violet are vital. They refer to spiritual energy centres known as chakras and are situated in the head. The colours and their ‘medical’ qualities were first officially listed by the Swiss scientist Dr Max Luscher, who said that appropriately coloured lights, applied to specific chakras, could treat ailments from depression to grief. Julia Kubler is one of Britain’s leading colour therapists and has been using colours to treat patients at her clinic at Manningtree, Essex, for 15 years. Purple, she says, ‘is consistent with intuition and higher understanding, with spirituality and meditation. It combines the coolness of blue with a bit of red that makes it not just passive but active.’
It is hardly the most outlandish of claims for this most enigmatic of colours. Variously touted as the colour of everything from insanity to equality, it is enjoying a new role as the symbol of political compromise. Purple may have had its origins in the ancient world, but thanks to a young chemist, it still has a brilliant future.
